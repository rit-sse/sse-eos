### What is EOS?
A collection of all our docker-compose files for all the parts of the sse webpage. And the documentation around bootstraping it.

### Background
Are you really confused at this point? You probably have a few questions. You're gonna need a few things to get started with EOS, one is [docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox). Docker is magical and this isn't the place to learn about that ecosystem, they have great documentation and tutorials for that.

Anything else you have questions on PLEASE open a git issue and we'll get it answered and back into the docs somewhere.
